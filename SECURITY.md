# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly
disclose your findings. We will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory
**"Report a Vulnerability"** tab in
`https://github.com/Neved4/<project>/security/advisories/new`.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the
progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional
information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team
maintaining the module.

## Notifications

Advance warnings that say that a new release is coming and, depending on
the sensitivity and availability of invitation, some of the following:

- _affected versions_
- _affected platforms_
- _possible mitigations_

Notifications are a disclosure of vulnerabilities. These will give some
information about the vulnerability, e.g. what features are affected,
mitigation strategies, and how the vulnerability was discovered.

These announcements will typically be made alongside new releases which fix
the issue.
